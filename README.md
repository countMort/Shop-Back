# Shop Admin Back End Project

### This project is built with Node.js + Express.

#### I spent a day trying to figure out how to work with firestore and in the end I realized that it was due to my region that I only could post data to the databse and could not get any. So after that I spent another day to create my own database and I genuinely loved it. The project is now using a custom database.


`The Authentication` part on the Back-End side is ready and you can view it but due to lack of time I couldn't finish that part for the Front-End.

## Please note that this project by default needs port 9905 of your local machine, if thats occupied, feel free to change it in the code but remember to also change it on the front end application.

The project has its own instance of `error handling` + `response generation`.

## There is a chance that you might face an error while installing the dependencies, I should note that my `node.js version is 20` and you need a package named `node-gyp` updated on your machine.

## Usage

```batch
npm install
```

or

```batch
yarn
```

And then

```
yarn dev
```
